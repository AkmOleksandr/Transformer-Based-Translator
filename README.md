# Transformer-Based-Translator

This project is a Transformer-based translator designed to convert English text to Ukrainian. The goal of this repo is to implement [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) architecture from scratch rather than create a powerful translator. The implementation is inspired by [Umar Jamil's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts), as showcased in his corresponding GitHub repository [pytorch-transformer](https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer).

## Getting Started

To explore the model's capabilities and see the results it can achieve, take a look at the [Translator-Train-Inference.ipynb](Translator-Train-Inference.ipynb) notebook.

## Usage

You have the option to train the model from scratch and use it directly by downloading the [Translator-Train-Inference.ipynb](Translator-Train-Inference.ipynb) notebook and running it on Google Colab.

Happy translating!
